```javascript
    "cosmosDB.graph.viewSettings": [
        {
            "vertexSettings": [
                {
                    // Default settings for all vertices
                    "displayProperty": [
                        // Display name property if exists, otherwise firstName if it exists, otherwise ID
                        "name",
                        "firstName"
                    ],
                    // Auto-choose color by label
                    "color": "auto",
                    // Show label after display property
                    "showLabel": true
                },
                {
                    // These setting apply to vertices with the label 'person'
                    "appliesToLabel": "person",
                    "color": "blue"
